I like AI bots and LLMS, it seems that we have invented a machine that learns exactly the way we do, it might free us from the burden of learning. But recent evidence suggests this freedom comes with a loss of neural engagement. In June 2025, MIT researchers monitored students writing essays under different conditions: brain-only, search-assisted, and AI-assisted.

The results were damning. The students using AI showed significantly lower neural engagement. Their brains were rotting under those conditions. On top of that, minutes after finishing, 83% of the AI group could not recall a single specific sentence from their own work. While the essays were grammatically correct and structurally sound, evaluators consistently described them as hollow or soulless.

This creates a paradox of homogenization. Large Language Models (LLMs) are designed to guess the next word based on averages of all written knowledge. They function like a weighted die biased toward what has been said before, because they have no curiosity or creativity. When humans use AI to generate ideas, the outputs tend to cluster, creating echoes of the same concepts. True human diversity comes from our unique life experiences our own weighted dice. Humans create mistakes, have biases, and take leaps of faith whilst writing. Even me writing this article is a gallop into the unknown, depths of my mind. When we rely entirely on AI, our collective creativity narrows into a repeating loop of the average.

I urge everyone reading this to go and create something, anything. The act of creation will always lie with us. In the times far far away, the last frontier will always be our creativity.
Excelsior!!!
